# Video-Prediction:
Future frame prediction in videos is a promising avenue for unsupervised video representation learning. Video frames are naturally generated by the inherent pixel flows from preceding frames based on the appearance and motion dynamics in the video.

Our goal in this project is to use various Deep-Learning/ Generative architecures to predict the future frames for a given real-time video. Also, in this project we tried to used the annotated text to evaluate whether it helps to explain the generation of correct future frames or not.
